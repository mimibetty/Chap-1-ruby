# Assign variables city and state to your current city and state of resi-
# dence. (If residing outside the U.S., substitute the analogous quantities.)
# 2. Using interpolation, print (using puts) a string consisting of the city and
# state separated by a comma and a space, as in “Los Angeles, CA”.
# 3. Repeat the previous exercise but with the city and state separated by a tab
# character.
# 4. What is the result if you replace double quotes with single quotes in the
# previous exercise?

city = "Da Nang"
state = "Viet Nam"
puts "#{city}, #{state}"
puts "#{city}\t#{state}"
puts '#{city}\t#{state}'
